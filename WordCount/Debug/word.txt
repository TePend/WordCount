According to a survey conducted among a group of people who were in the same college 10 years ago, those
whose grade-point average was in the middle fifty percent, all become rich
or managers of different fields, while not a single young man of the upper
ten percent becomes an executive or boss.
One ingredient, among other things, is good interpersonal skills.
With a wide circle of friends who can be trusted to provide information and resources,
your chances of success are much higher. On the contrary, if you are competent in your profession,
but have difficulty in getting along with your colleagues and even your boss, you can hardly survive the corporation.
Another component is the ability to express oneself. In todayâ€™s
world, what really counts is the ability to express oneself rather than technical
competence or professional knowledge. The larger the organization of which you are an
employee, and the fiercer the competition, the more important it will be that you know
how to convey your thoughts and convince others of your ideas.
To sum up, according to my observation, academic brightness is only part of the story, the other factors are very important.
